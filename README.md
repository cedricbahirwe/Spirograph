# Spirograph
## Spirograph is a geometric drawing device that produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. The well-known toy version was developed by British engineer Denys Fisher and first sold in 1965. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph)

P.S: It will crash your device if you keep running it for a while.
